# Go-Social

**Go-Social** is a social networking platform built with Go. It allows users to register, create posts, follow/unfollow other users, comment on posts, and manage user roles. The project includes features like user authentication, email invitations, and role-based access control. PostgreSQL is used as the database, and SendGrid is integrated for sending email notifications.

   FROM_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
   TOKEN_SECRET=example
   ```

3. **Start PostgreSQL Database**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

- **Install Go Dependencies**: Run `go mod tidy` to install and clean up dependencies.

## 🧠 Conclusion

Through this project, I learned how to build a backend using Go and explored Go concepts in depth. I applied these concepts to create APIs and implement the repository pattern for clean and maintainable code. I also gained hands-on experience with PostgreSQL and database migrations. Throughout development, I wrote SQL queries, debugged various issues, and dealt with complex database errors — especially the tricky ones that occur when migrations or queries fail. This project was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my understanding of backend development in Go.
